# Youtube comments analysis

the purpose of this study is to analyze youtube comments about specific products.

In that case, we'll look at reviews about headphones.

The idea is to find out which brands are most talked about in specified videos and the users' feelings about these products.

To do so, we will:

# extract all comments from the chosen video;

# exploratory data analysis for insights;

# machine learning to predict sentiments.
