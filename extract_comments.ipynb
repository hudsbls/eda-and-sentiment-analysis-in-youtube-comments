Thats what I also thought at first. I used to say its the same components moving in the same housing, sam magnets, same coil, same cone, etc so how can it change. So I let it burn in for a while and then when I tried it the next day it was sounding quite different. Its usually a little warmer smoother and less harsh after a burn in and I noticed the same too on a couple of other headpjones and earphones that I owned. So I checked it up and some say that the burn in loosens up the drivers to reach their full potential because they are a bit stiff after manufacture. So its not a myth. If I had been using them for a couple of days and felt the sound changed then I could have agreed with you that my ears adapted to it. But u was not using it during the burn in and then the next day when I tried them they were quite different, not just for one but most of the headphones I owned. So its not a myth but quite a reality.', 'I really appreciate this video.

The design is cool with self adjusting headpband and cardanic pivoting cups and quite robust. The K240 are widely used in studios for this and because are semiclosed so provide a bit of isolation but not at claustrophobic levels. Generally the sound is targeted to acoustic music: no bass below 100 Hz and a bit of emphasis up top. The discontinued K181DJ was good: good isolation and good timbre with full spectrum from top to bottom. Not detailed enough to make minute choises in mixing. I had also the K240 monitor (old 600 ohm version): toppy highs and no lows but \"spacious\" sound (some resonances in the cups used with gusto).

I already own a pair of Bose SoundLink Around-Ear Wireless Headphones II which I initially bought just for listening to music but I'm now also using them when producing, I use them with Reference 4 so that it gives me a flat frequency response but I'm not sure if they should be used for studio work and might perhaps need headphones more dedicated to producing. My question is if I bought the DT 770 Pro's (which are also supported headphones in Reference 4) would I be wasting my money because Reference 4 would also calibrate the DT 770's with a flat response the same is it does with my Bose headphones?

If they are neutral sounding, I would love to know the definition of neutral. No headphones are neutral. It's a total lie. The important thing is to learn how your cans translate to other systems and that is done by referencing mastered tracks and translating that to your mixes. So, you can learn the 7506s and be an amazing engineer using them (ask Andrew Scheps for instance), but in my mind, why make life difficult. The 7506s are just hard to get on with. Everybody is different but for me, I have learnt the Beyerdynamic range back to front, so for my mobile studio rig I use the 770 Pros a lot of the time for writing and tracking and checking low end when I mix. The 880 Pros for the mid-range and especially getting vocals right and then the 1990 Pros for the top end (all 250 Ohm). I can confidently get my mixes and masters for clients 95% finished just using that method if I have to (which nowadays is becoming the norm with a lot of studio shutting down) and then I finish off in my studio on my Genelecs and Dynaudios.
