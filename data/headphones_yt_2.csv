In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","I am also a big fan of Beyerdynamic, I LOVE my DT880s pro. I've made full productions from scratch to mastering only using this. Great guide, cheers!"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","FYI for people the Pro/Studio/unnamed 770s are all the same.  The name depends on where you get them from.  Studios are from guitar center, Pros are from Amazon.  Literally no difference you just need to pay attention to impedence."

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc"," @Christos Vogiatzis  the 40x is more balanced in general kind of W sounding but bass is not as boomy and highs a touch flatter. Both suffer from flaky pads syndrome as pads are the same for them. Best if you look at measurements from Oratory1990, Crinacle, and diyAudioheaven (he has list of mods for many hps). I have 50X, but now most of my listening is on moded HD58X (nice midrange happy signature) as they are way more comfortable and have nicer stage. I use 50s for second opinion as their base extension is better than 58X."

In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Cheers Gavin!

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","With each stage of my music production journey, you always seem to put out a video addressing whatever it is I'm researching at the time. I love this channel! Keep it coming!"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","The Sony MDR 7506 are an industry standard, you will find them everywhere in the pro world. *But* they are a standard for a very specific reason: they are very cheap (relative to a production/set budget), light, and they accentuate all the wrong frequencies in the ""right"" way, making them quite good for monitoring/tracking audio (of all sort, but mostly vocals and ambiance) and noticing problems very fast (like somebody just activate the AC on set, or a phone is ringing on the floor below).

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc"," @•_•  They should work just fine for that, they are pretty flat."

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.

Usually you want some mid-forward cans, with a lot of details in the high, for transcribing.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Woah ATH M20x is my first ever headphone investment too...

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc", @Ali  They are the 80 omh version. I don't find that they're too bassy but we all might have different thresholds for what works for us vs. what doesn't. I'd contact the MFG to see if they have any tips/suggestions to get the best performance out of them or exchange it for a different variant if you can't get it to work best for you.

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc", @Jonny Jewell depends on the device if it's a phone then 80 should be ok but if your not happy with it you could get a external amp

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

I see the ones you have in the video are 80 Ohms - is it important to get these ones? Thank you :-)"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Omg thank you so much! I've been wanting to get over ear headphones for a long time but I never knew where to start searching while staying within my budget.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Simple, honest and direct review!"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc",Thank you so much for this. I was actually looking for a set of wireless over-ear cans but after watching this I think it’s time to replace my budget Beyers with the 770 pros. I still need a wireless pair though. I’m hearing great things about the Amiron but the price is scary. Can you recommend a cheaper option?

8:20 - AKG K702 Review   
9:30 - Final Summary


Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",This is priceless and comprehensive! Thank you as always. I've found your channel a few months ago and am binging everything. I've JUST bought my first pair of something sort of decent last week. Superlux 668. Where do these stand compared to let's say the Beyerdynamic?
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","I would just like to say that burning in headphones is a myth, they sound the exact same out of the box as they will after a week of using. It only seems to be that way cus it takes some time for your ears to adapt to the sound of new headphones(about 3 weeks to be able to fully understand their sound) so just playing them over night does nothing. ik its not really plausable to wear each of these headphones for 3 weeks at a time to make a review for them but in order to ideally review them thats whats necessary"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","Nope its not a myth. Thats what I also thought at first. I used to say its the same components moving in the same housing, sam magnets, same coil, same cone, etc so how can it change. So I let it burn in for a while and then when I tried it the next day it was sounding quite different. Its usually a little warmer smoother and less harsh after a burn in and I noticed the same too on a couple of other headpjones and earphones that I owned. So I checked it up and some say that the burn in loosens up the drivers to reach their full potential because they are a bit stiff after manufacture. So its not a myth. If I had been using them for a couple of days and felt the sound changed then I could have agreed with you that my ears adapted to it. But u was not using it during the burn in and then the next day when I tried them they were quite different, not just for one but most of the headphones I owned. So its not a myth but quite a reality."

I have a pair of the AKG 240s from when they were made in Austria and loved them but they are wearing out and the replacement cable has too high impedence so I lose nice clarity I originally had.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","And yes, what a coincidence! I was just looking for headphones when this popped up."
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

You recommended in one of your other videos that studio monitors should be flattened with Sonarworks. Since they offer the same software for headphones, wouldn't that eliminate all the problems with headphone coloring?"
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Great stereo field but after a couple of years, I swapped them for the Audio Technica 50's. Theres something a lot more exciting about the audio technicas to my ears. The 770s sound vanilla / flat in comparison."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Was looking for something like this! Great video! Could you do one on which studio monitors you recommend?
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",are the still working?
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Great review and format! Perfect mix of objective and subjective. You know it's true because I have the HD280 pro and am happy with them hahaha. But honestly I mostly listen to music and enjoy the linear sound, passive noise reduction, and fit of them. They do clamp down really hard for sure! Great stuff! I'm subscribed :)"

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

9:30 - Final Summary


Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Thanks Michael I found your video just when I'm looking for some headphones !

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",I wish I had DT cause they look so comfortable I wish I could touch those earpads
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

9:30 - Final Summary


Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Guess I gotta start saving up for the 770 and an interface! To be honest, every single pair of headphones in the video are better than my current pair. My current pair hurts both my head and ears. The bass is insanely boosted too. But, alas! Things are really expensive here!"
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Amazing video, not so many reviews are as reliable as yours. Thank you, great video."
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",This is a great video and the kind of thing I subscribe to your channel to see. A great video with the Christmas season coming up soon. Thank you.

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

I know they aren't especially made for music production but they work really well because of their flat sound, a large frequency spectrum and their build quality which is absolutely insane.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Great and detailed comparison! Thanks 👏🏼

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

I have both the M40x and dt770 and the latter definitely benefits from much tighter and deeper bass. By the way, you can buy different size earpads on eBay or Amazon in case your ears are smaller or larger than average. I find the M40x earpads don't quite fit over my ears; the dt770 pads are larger."

Terrible first impression etc","Very nice review, thanks Michael! I've been using the m50 for quite some time now for recording, mixing and also DJing and I'm really happy with them! I would almost have gotten the 770s because some of my band mates love them, but the problem about them back then was their high impedance, which was about 250 ohms if I remember correctly, and that's just too much for some tasks and some audio interfaces unfortunately... I think by now they have lower impedance models also, I think that's important to know for people when they buy headphones :)"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",I got the dt 990 pros and they are perfect for me. Your thoughts?

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc",Great review! I love my Sennheiser HD 280's. They are still going strong after two decades however I need to buy a replacement headband. I got these because they also had great noise cancelling ability. When you put them on they really do block out all other noise. I used them in the early noughties on flights to Australia for two years running to block out the sound of the aircraft and other passengers and screaming babies. Worked like a charm. Also great for DJing and pretty much everything else too. The sound quality is incredible. I have to admit the cushioning on those Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro's look great!

Terrible first impression etc","A very good review and evaluation of these models, thanks for expending your own money to provide the review.  Don’t forget that one can EQ/preamp the source to remove harsh highs, or to scoop the minds, or to balance the bass end for “thump” without toilet bowl rumble.  So, with good EQ practices, one can make any one of these models to fit personal sound profile needs.  For this list, I’d consider any of the top 5.  It can often come down to which one is most comfortable to wear, not to discount the size and quality of the drivers, of course."

- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",glad to see you also like the AT M50x it is my mastering headphones that I use as well as genelecs monitors

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Please make a video like this on studio moniters and audio interface!
AUDIO INTERFACE! do this first"
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","The 240M2 are studio headphones they say 55 ohms, but they an need amp that can push 150ohms+ headphone. They will lack bass and treble if your you can't can't power them, the same with 702s."

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","The AKG K240 (K240MkII, K240 Studio, and the Massdrop/AKG M220 are all the same headphone: I've taken apart each one to reveal identical components, right down to the model # on the drivers themselves) need a capable amplifier; they will sound meagre, weak and thin otherwise. They should also be recognized as a product of their time: the current 55ohm incarnation dates back to the mid-70's, when they were originally a 600ohm headphone(!). They will reproduce, with accuracy (when properly amplified), any instrument in an orchestra. That's what they were originally designed for. They will not, however, reproduce frequencies that can only be generated in software."

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Thank you for not being like the other youtubers going from 10 to 1 to make sure you watch the whole video :*
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc", @Fredi  Audio Technica headphones are fine as long as you take good care of it. They are the best sounding for your budget.
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Hey! I bought the Audio Technica M30x and plugged it in my audio interface (kontakt audio 1). The sound is too thin & lacks bass. Why is this occurring?
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Same thought here, most bass specific headphones end up with a loss in your treble or mid range. AkG I feel does a good job focusing on classical listeners."

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Regardless of the headphones you're going to buy, always bear in mind that a detachable cable can go a really long way as far as longevity is concerned.

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Agreed. A detachable cable is a godsend, unless you know your way with a solder iron and can do a good one yourself."

9:30 - Final Summary


Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Yea and the m40x is much preferred over the m50x's because the sound is flat and more accurate
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","IMO the DT770 is highly overrated and not ideal for mixing. The ""quality"" it has are a psycoacoustic byproduct of the out of phase bass that may sound more spacious and less slamming (it's just a badly done bass reflex), recessed mids (most of the music will be pulled back and out of the head) and peaks in the highs at 6k (sibilance)  and 10k (fake detail and metallic attack). Also badly rendered transients (drivers and cups not dumped and thick foam in tront of the driver). I get how someone how has never heard something better than the earbuds delivered with the phone could like that (I still prefer Sennheiser MX400 earbuds with foam tips to DT770 !) but I can't understand the amount of pros (I am a pro) that like that model O_o. It's like being fooled by a Bose boombox."

Terrible first impression etc"," @Kristofer Prophet  Hello, I didn't know of that mod. The graphs look good compared with HD600 and HD650 (I had booth side by side for years: they're good but no low bass, 600 is grainy in the highs, 650 has mid bass hump and no grain in the highs. Booth a bit too much energy between 2k and 6k, 2-3 dB. Mortal sin: muffled transient response like a thick drape in front of the speakers. Expansive pads that age quickly and change the sound for the worse once flattened out). Maybe there's still too much energy between 5k and 8k. The general downward slope is good. It might be worth a listen but I would like to see the impulse response and square response (farewell innerfidelity) because those show the behaviour in time.

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:

Terrible first impression etc"," @innerscape  I will ask him for those graphs and charts! I don’t know if I will know what I am looking at though, nor do I know if I want to dish out money to the seller if the headphones won’t be that good. 

I want a good pair of closed backs because of my noisy environment and ambient noise, to block that out while mixing and mastering. I was thinking of the Neumanns, but I am not sure what my best option would be."

Terrible first impression etc"," @Josh Boucher  IMO not up to snuff with modern stuff. The design is cool with self adjusting headpband and cardanic pivoting cups and quite robust. The K240 are widely used in studios for this and because are semiclosed so provide a bit of isolation but not at claustrophobic levels. Generally the sound is targeted to acoustic music: no bass below 100 Hz and a bit of emphasis up top. The discontinued K181DJ was good: good isolation and good timbre with full spectrum from top to bottom. Not detailed enough to make minute choises in mixing. I had also the K240 monitor (old 600 ohm version): toppy highs and no lows but ""spacious"" sound (some resonances in the cups used with gusto). With a quartet they can sound ""magical"" but also a one trick pony."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Straight to the favorites and a detail description. Thanks for not making us wait through the whole video. It actually made watching the whole video worth it because of the straightforwardness from the beginning.

Terrible first impression etc",I never heard that you need to run music through your headphones to burn them in. But I just recently bought a pair of DT 990 and didn’t like the sound of them when I first put them on. It’s been a few weeks of mixing and mastering and I really love them now. I assumed that I was just getting used to them but after hearing this I am thinking you are right.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",It's like you are a mind reader! Just yesterday started to look for new headphones 🎧 thanks! Hope I can win the giveaway though ;)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","On the official homepage of Beyerdynamic the DT 770 Pro is currently selling for 118€ instead of 155€. around 60hrs remaining. Just watched this video and a few others and everyone praised those headphones, that I want to have them, too. Keep on producing awesome videos Michael =)"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Def check out the Hifiman HE 400i 2020 edition. Detail, resolve, and resolution is far superior on these compared with any you reviewed."

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Hey Michael :) Thanks for doing this headphone review! Was super interesting to watch. I've always been a fan of Beyerdynamic! :D Would love to get a set of DT Pro headphones someday. Oh also! I wanted to ask if you could consider checking out the JTS 565HP monitor headphones for reviewing. I feel like it might be a set of headphones that flies under the radar quite a bit! :) Its been my go to headphones for  years. Thanks!!

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","I've been using the M40's for a while now and I love it, very clear sounding, my mixes end up kind of muffled but I believe that's due to me not being aggressive enough with larger numbers or just being an EQ novice(Producing your own 11 track album with different guitar tones each song is very time consuming). Keep in mind to listen through multiple outputs! It's entirely possible that you can ""hear too much"" with headphones but it shouldn't be a big issue if at all.

I've been using my razor Kraken headset for a while now and I picked up a mid priced set of audio technica phones thinking that they would be better. I ended up returning the audio technica studio quality headphones because they just couldn't match the range and depth of sound I was getting from my ""gaming"" headphones. FYI, all the options that effect the sound (bass boost, sound normalization, etc) are turned off on my Kraken headset."

Terrible first impression etc","Very helpful video, thanks! There is one thing I wanted to try and get my head around and it's to do with calibrating the headphones in Sonarworks Reference 4. I was thinking of purchasing the DT 770 Pro's but was wondering, in your opinion, whether you think it would be worth it for me. I already own a pair of Bose SoundLink Around-Ear Wireless Headphones II which I initially bought just for listening to music but I'm now also using them when producing, I use them with Reference 4 so that it gives me a flat frequency response but I'm not sure if they should be used for studio work and might perhaps need headphones more dedicated to producing. My question is if I bought the DT 770 Pro's (which are also supported headphones in Reference 4) would I be wasting my money because Reference 4 would also calibrate the DT 770's with a flat response the same is it does with my Bose headphones? Or will the quality of the headphones have an impact despite the calibration by Reference 4? Hope that makes sense?! Thanks in advance."

8:20 - AKG K702 Review   
9:30 - Final Summary


Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Have you ever tried the Klip Xtreme ZoundMaster? also nice video man!

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Also, don't you think closed headphones are more fatiguing and somehow can give a ""false"" image compared to semiclosed (that of course have the bleed problem while recording)?"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Having had and used the 770 PRO for 3 years now, I would much rather try the M50 or M40 instead. Build quality of my 770 has fallen off substantially since I first got them to the point that they are starting to fall apart. Note this is with having used them for more or less every day for 3+ years."

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

9:30 - Final Summary


Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Have you tried some of those headphones with headphone amps and found any differences ?
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Thanks to drop this video at right TIME 😊🙌❤️

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Should've done more open back headphones
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Thanks for your videos. Very very helpful. I already have a Bose QC 2 headphones, would you recommend using them for music production? Thanks"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Sand me one of the headphones

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Thank you for another great video !!!

1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.

Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro is my dream but now it's out of reach financially. I've been working for several years in my home-studio small room and always suffering the lack of bass and abscence of low-end what eventually ended up with lame mixes with blown out cranked lows. "

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Not technically but I keep hearing different things about whether your average USB powered sound interface can drive 250 ohm properly. Any advice welcome."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Beyerdynamics are definitely my go to

8:20 - AKG K702 Review   
9:30 - Final Summary


Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Nice vid! Just one question though, how did you purchase K702 at only 154? On their website it's like 300 something."
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Always gotta like and drop an algorithm comment for my boi Michael!!!
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

8:20 - AKG K702 Review   
9:30 - Final Summary


Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","that is disappointing about the 240Mk IIs, I have the 240 studios and love them. Have had them for several years and they give really nice response."

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Thanks for this review.... Salute
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc",I got the superlux hd681 a few years ago and recently (last month) bought the dt 770 pro. I actually prefer the sound of the superlux. This is probably because i am so used to their sound. I also think that they are so good compared to the 770s because they are half-open.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Hello man , you are one of the best teachers in internet... so clear your style!!!

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

I am only a little bit confused between Beyerdynamic PDT770 Pro and Audiotechnica ATH M50x what it comes to audio quality which one is the best for you? And if is Beyerdynamic PDT770 Pro which Ohm would you choose 80 Ohm or 250 Ohm? Thanks in advance!

1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","I got the Sony MDR headphones as a recommendation from another professional composer. They're not very comfortable, but I couldn't tell if they were lacking any kind of sound quality, because I had no other studio-quality headphones to compare them with. Thank you for this test, I'll keep it in mind when it's time for a replacement."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Audio Technica M50x in top 10 headphones?
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

I had the Sony MDR 7506 for nearly 9 years and have to say i get the point about build-quality feeling like plastic, but they lasted me for years. But i want to try out the Audio Technica and Beyerdynamic because i hear a lot of good stuff about them aswell. The Sony was always recommended as an ''industry standard'' but i feel you hit the nail right on the head when talking about comfort, feel and soundspace."

Terrible first impression etc",Michael Excellent video I’ve been doing research I have  Audio Technica T22s that have wonderful rich sound but I broke the arching ear band! I was looking at the One Audio units but was a little leery based on customer reviews so then I upped my budget and was thinking of the ATH-M30X but still wasn’t sure. But your video to me has been very helpful. Thank you!

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",What about the Creative Aurvana Live! SE?

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","I've had the K702s for years now... Like, they were over double the price when I bought them lmao. I agree with the bass, it can be extremely hard to mix sub frequencies with these headphones. It does burn in with age and you get some of it, but you kinda get used to mediocre subbass it. I bought them for their weight, openback-ness and sound stage. However, I do not like the build quality. My hair always gets trapped in the rail assembly and had to cut away the clear plastic guides since they cracked over time. The bands holding up the cups also broke, and I've had to literally remove and resolder some of the wires going from the jack to the drivers, since the thin wire broke. Granted, they do fall off my chair a lot, and are beat up to hell, but they're SOLID headphones."

- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",what about bleed when recording ???

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","I've watched this twice now and it's a great video. Even for people just getting into the audiophile world this is pretty easy to understand and you cover all the relevant points perfectly and accurately while pointing out any biases you might have. I got the M40X over two years ago after a lot of research and a video like this would have made my life much easier. One thing I'd like to point out is that the M40X are even more comfortable with earpad replacements and in my opinion, M40X + 20$ earpads is a better option over M50X."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Thanks I think I definitely buy the dt 770 pro the ath m50x looks inconfortable
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.

4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Try the k240 studios not the mkii like he did.  Much difference in listening imo.  The mkii is known for being sub par for many. The studios I have are very tough and over 5 years old.
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

8:20 - AKG K702 Review   
9:30 - Final Summary


Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Aw man, what happened to you finger bro?"
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","I love my audio technicas for the sound profile, but after a few years of use the padding material around the ears starts peeling and will leave you with small black spots around the ears after every use. Be wary of that"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",I love your videos because they are hones and from you heart. Keep it up and make more headphone videos

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Is there somebody who knows what to do, when some Instruments mute themself after the export?
Its driving me crazy.😡"
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

The only headphones I have are gaming ones which are honestly really bad for monitoring and the cable is too short when I record. After this video though I think I might prefer the 770s. I am wondering tho, how long is the cable for the 770s and are there multiple cable options?"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",My dt 770 pro 80 ohm came today but still waiting on my amp. Although.... works surprisingly well on my phone without the amp

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:

Terrible first impression etc","I've been using the Sony MDR7506 for 20+ years for everyday stuff. I love them. The most recent ones I've bought were not as good as the ones I got around 1999-2000 timeframe. Nearly everyone in the radio and audio production has a pair and uses them as a way of sampling the real world sound and radio DJs loved them. I also have a bunch of much more expensive cans. Last night I ordered the Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro 80 ohms. Can't wait. I think they will usurp the Sony's. I often sit in my home office/studio working in the wee hours where I don't want to disturb Sue sleeping upstairs. If she's awake I listen to everything through studio monitors or Klipsch speakers. It's sad the Sony's are going downhill. Here in the US you can buy them new for $89 often making them quite affordable. The Beyerdynanic DT770 Pro 80 Ohms were $159--almost 2X the price. Those Sony's are the only < $100 USD cans I've ever used. I also have Bose QC35 for noisy environments. Decent but not exceptional. Airpods for walks (I walk 6-8 km a day). It's amazing how each piece of gear (or kit as you might say in UK) has it's own niche use case. The trouble people get into is to assume ""one size fits all""."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","I also see 7506 everywhere... so I bought it for my first monitoring headphone. It was only good when recording... so I bought Sennheiser HD250 headphone, but still not satisfied. I should try DT770 Pro someday..."
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Did you heard about the austrian headphones? What do you think?

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

This is more important to me than sound quality as I already have open-back headphones for mixing."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc"," @In The Mix  that could be the issue, but the Q701s were a limited edition so slightly different model."
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Been using my Sony MDR7506, my mixing has only improved, not the flatest headphones, but are very truthful about the recordings"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",do dt770pro 32ohm and 80ohm sound different?
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","I like them a lot. Never tried anything else though, so I can't offer a comparison. They could be a little more comfortable but the sound makes up for it. The bass in particular is really good. I googled an online frequency generator and I start to hear a little rumble around 10Hz and it seems to reach pretty much full volume around 20Hz. I think we can't actually hear 10Hz but you can feel the rumble. It's like a pressure in your ears which actually isn't that pleasant if it's too loud."

- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Helpful but don't even have a budget for ATH M20x
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

They're unusable unless I use a large elastic band around my head, (which I've tried but is very uncomfortable). Also, the hinges can creak really annoyingly with any head movement. My pair is quite old though."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Listen, if you need to run this entire test again for us that wear glasses, I'd be happy to help :D"
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Those DT770’s are the last piece of gear I need! I have had the senheiser hd280 pros for years and they hurt my ears.

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

The more Ohms is more bass or what would be the difference?   The higher also you need at least a mini amplifier to reproduce accurately, doesn´t it?"

- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","Great video as usual.  High quality and very informative.  I have a pair of the SONYs and, let me tell you, I have heard for YEARS that they are used in many studios and they are industry standard, etc.  Well, I recently tested them with an online website that looks at neutrality and WOW, was I surprised!  They are anything BUT neutral.  I am thinking about getting rid of them altogether. I might keep them just for leisure listening as they color the sound nicely. I have a pair of ATH-M50X for mixing and the Senn HD-58X for mastering.  Both are VERY neutral."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Excellent video.  Which of your selections would be best for watching tv?

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",How's the AKG K92?
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",What amp/dac do you used on k702?

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",the akg open back you really need to get used to them first when i tried akg open back i thought sounded horrible but if you stick with them month or so you'll never want to use closed back for producing mixing etc ever again
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","The headphones I use are some Sennheiser HD 435
These are old that I got from my father. The sound quality is good with some bass and mids, but they are really unconfortable has they have a terrible cloth as a hear path. + they do not isolate sound very well.
But for what I have, it's very decent"

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",I would like the know if the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO 32 Ohm are suitable if I plan on plugging them directly into an Xbox controller? Thx!
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",The style of the AkG driver might not be for your listening taste. They're not for bass heavy listening usually.

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","Food for thought, I have both the k702 and DT770 pro 80 ohm, personally I think the bass in the 770's are not defined, not punchy just thick lacking clarity, just my opinion and my ears. I reach for my K702's all the time, like you  do most mixdowns in headphones, viewed as a tool for a job the k702's are perfect for me,  again maybe my head but I have no ear fatigue with the K702's but do after a while with the 770's, they get hot. After a mixdown in the k702's I listen to the overall balance in the 770's and I almost never feel like I need to adjust the bass."

Terrible first impression etc"," @lewisportsmouth  Hiya Lewis, I've been learning producing at home using FL Studio for about five years. I've tried my hand at drum n bass, trance, psytrance and my latest effort techno - skober/ spartac that kinda thing so like you the bass I want defined. I'm using tannoy's 5"" and they are great! Lots and lots of bass! But also nice and clear, I listened to the Yamaha HS5 as well but already had Tannoy hi fi speakers (and B&W) and think Tannoy make great stuff, the studio monitors are a bit ""hissy"" at low level, but I could hear that a bitwith the HS5. Being in a flat I have to use my headphones the most and my rooms not treated. I think for what it's worth, you're set up sound great for hearing the "" detail"". Happy producing Lewis 😀"

9:30 - Final Summary


Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Instead of the K240, try the K371 or K361. Those two blow K240 by far."
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",First view

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","After like 10 years of using AKG K 240 MII last year I finally decided to go for Beyerdynamic DT 770 pro and it was an eye (or rather ear)opener!! DT's are so much better,no doubt.Great soundstage for closed-back too. But the dilemma was 80 or 250 Ohm? so I went on Beyerdynamic website where there's the most credible information regarding this and purchased..32 ohm.Work great with anything,interface,phone,whatever, though the cable could be longer..Great video,as always:)"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Please make a review of free DAWs such as Ardour

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","Hey man, I currently have some AKG K240's and I, like you find they are severely lacking in bass respons. I like the sound of the  Beyerdynamics but there are a bewildering array off various ohm sizes and other stuff to consider (according to Thomann :) ) Could you tell me the exact model type you are reviewing so I can buy the same ones you have? As a side note; I bought some Kali LP 6 monitors on your recommendation and have been immensely pleased with them, so I've come to you again for heaphones :)"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Michael bro! what happened to your finger? Too much high cut? XD
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

9:30 - Final Summary


Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Would also recc the samson sr850. Great and cheap!
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","best for me now is Ollo audio, worth it"
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Previously used a m50x for like 6yrs, and bought a dt770 pro and immediately it's like a different level of headphones, i can hear more details"
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:

- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Regarding AKG - I was sure it's a problem with a laptop hardware, not the headphones. I've got K92, super comfy but soud is sort of weird. Like in a big hall"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","Thank you for review, but you have very subjective opinion about AKG K 240. They are really great for listening and mixing ""live"" music such classic, Jazz and so on, they are very mild on highs and have very airy scene. I can listen them and mixing piano and strings music for hours and I don't feel tired. They are not for rock or dance music because of lack of bass. And I also have ATH m40 and Sony MDR. ATH is great, has a quite flat eq without evident ups and downs, but bass is not enough for me. As for Sony they are not specialized in mixing music as I know. It's monitor headphones, but mostly for that who works in film industry, for camera men for example. They have very harsh high mids and as you concerned very compressed sound. But it suits me great and comfortable, even for my  big head :)"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

I'm looking for a new pair of headphones, but I'm not that sure on which one. I've heard much good about the Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pro. They're on top of thomann most popular headphones right now as well. Should I go for them? Are they a good choice? I produce EDM music."

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc"," @Tylan Cariño  My m40x was on its 4th year being my daily driver for mixing before my cat dropped it and one ear lost rotation support, I have it glued now sacrificing the side rotation and that's it, it's still kicking."

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.

Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","I am with you 100% on the Sony's. Back in the 90s all my peers swore by the 7506s and I stuck with the Beyerdynamics. A few high profile engineers gave the 7506s good reviews and everybody suddenly called them the industry standard. If they are neutral sounding, I would love to know the definition of neutral. No headphones are neutral. It's a total lie. The important thing is to learn how your cans translate to other systems and that is done by referencing mastered tracks and translating that to your mixes. So, you can learn the 7506s and be an amazing engineer using them (ask Andrew Scheps for instance), but in my mind, why make life difficult. The 7506s are just hard to get on with. Everybody is different but for me, I have learnt the Beyerdynamic range back to front, so for my mobile studio rig I use the 770 Pros a lot of the time for writing and tracking and checking low end when I mix. The 880 Pros for the mid-range and especially getting vocals right and then the 1990 Pros for the top end (all 250 Ohm). I can confidently get my mixes and masters for clients 95% finished just using that method if I have to (which nowadays is becoming the norm with a lot of studio shutting down) and then I finish off in my studio on my Genelecs and Dynaudios. The 770s and 880s are cheap for what they are capable of (and the 1990s are not exactly expensive compared to other comparable brands) and if I am ever asked, I highly recommend their range. Thanks for the video."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Yesss I have the Dt770

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","0 have bluetooth connection, bluetooth has too much latency and not enough fidelity for pro audio editing. Bluetooth is however great for consumer headphones and I personally have bluetooth headphones for casual listening and mix checking :)"
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",hold my shure srh1540
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","You are welcome. If you need them for recording and mixing, get the 770. If you want the very beat for mixing snd mastering only, then the 990 might be better suited. Remembering that noise will escape the 990 so everyone in the room can hear your music!"

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","You could have added the money you spent on all the headphones, added another $1000 and got yourself a pair of Focal Clears :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",This will be useful for me because my senheisser 598 hurts the top of my head and gives me a dent really easily

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",i have the sennheiser 280 and i like them alot i was abit disappointed when i hear you gave him a bad review. but i dont have the two version but the first i think so maby that matters. idk but overal a good review

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","great video.  I agree for the most part.  Have the AKG 240 mkii and I'm shocked how bad they sound compared to other headphones i've acquired.  Have had the AT m30x for a couple years, very nice for the price, with excellent isolation.  Just got the m50x, which is a nice upgrade all around, worth it if you can afford them - if not, don't sweat it, the 30x are like 90% as good imo.    Had the Beyerdynamic dt770 (32ohm), which had the best comfort and overall sound imo, however they were not balanced - the left channel was noticeably louder, so i returned them.  Also, they are a bit bulky and noticed this when leaning my head back on a seatback or headboard of my bed, the bulk actually was an issue.  Overall, get the AT m50x!"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",I looked at the Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro but settled for the DT770 M (80 ohm non Pro) being best for drummers because of the better isolation spec but also use them for music production.
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc", @Tylan Cariño  amazing man first track i produced on them showed the difference in my mixes so much better an even got me my first signing

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",What about AKG K52 ???

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","The reason the Sony headphones are so highly rated is because they have such a neutral flat response, which is ideal for editing.  Most of the others you reviewed had a base bias, or extended mid range etc,
Which isn’t recommended if your editing audio.
That’s why they are the industry standard,  not because they sound the most pleasing when listening to music!"

Terrible first impression etc","Got the DT-770 pros just a week ago. They're great. I really had to get used the extra high end it offered in contrast to my old Razer Kraken V2s. My old ones also clearly lacked sub (which the DT-770 made really obvious) and has quite a mid boost. That lack of mid boost caused the DT-770 to sound scooped to my ears, so that took getting used to as well.
But they're great!"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc",Interesting findings. I like a nice flat response I don't want my headphones coloring my mix and also not heavy on bass I like things natural but no budget to low budget and finding something that's comfortable is really tough. I have settled on the $30 kicker Rebrand from Monoprice with detachable cord however I do find them a bit uncomfortable after an hour. However I did find the Audio Technica 40x comfortable when I try them at a group I recommended them for and I found them comfortable and i am kind of wondering if I should get a pair.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","The DT990 Pro are excellent for everything besides recording and live sound, as the open back lets sound out into the room. They are a great option if your music production involves no recording"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

How would you go about to check if an audio interface can support the required ohms or which preamp / headphone amp would you choose?

- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",he used his own money. so i guess you guys should leave a like so it gets more views  to help this great guy

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc",I can argue that k240 is a great headphone. I have the old version though but I think they are the same. Mine sound really good. They do lack bass I agree. But they are actually fairly detailed to my ears. But I don't know I might be wrong but I like my pair.

Opened headphones like Senns HD600/650 or AKG612/712 actually benefit from reasonable curve-flattening eq for an actual critical work, as they tend to have bit of a rollback in the lower bass."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",how lomg did you use your m40x?

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",DT770 or DT990?
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",And what about of DT 990 pro ? Are they even better then 770 ???
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Apologies if this has been mentioned already:
Seems like the DT 770 Pro's price has increased significantly since this post, or is just more pricey in Canada ($250) but ah, I'm still going to buy them, based on your review (and many other happy online reviews!)  "

I mean right now I use Sennheiser HD 4.40s for both producing and DJing and they are not even true studio headphones

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Want headphones for phone and producing bluetooth is ok only bluetooth headphones always have a little bit of latency

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","Hi! out of curiosity, among those headphones which didn't make it to the top, is there the V-Moda crossfade? I've been watching reviews about the DT 770 and they're always praised but I ran into reviews about v moda headphones, and they seem to be praised as well and comparable in sound quality to the DT770, emphasizing a little bit the bass, with the perks of having, the very useful, detachable cable and the foldability like the ath-m50x, and even there is a bluetooth version, that for what I have watched in reviews, are exactly in sound quality to the wired version, of course, when the Bluetooth version is wired as well. So I am interested in your comments as I tried looking up the V-Moda in your videos but you don't haven any video dedicated to them. Thanks for the enjoyable reviews."

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","i have here multiple AKG's (240, 701, 712pro) in the case of the 701 i have 3 of them. One, the oldest sounds indeed better than the newer ones and reminiscent to the experience i get with Quad Electrostatic Loudspeakers (ESL63) or STAX headphones)  Its the one that still has the ""Made in Austria"" on the sides. But in addition to that, its important for the AKG's to drive them with a proper power source (iE Headphone Amp and match the voltage (like voltage level of at least 19.55 dBV at a load of 65.99 ohms is desirable) see here for a lot of details. the experience you will have if you just ""plug"" somehow will be random as it depends how well your interface can deal with them. it will be luck without amping correctly.

To quote the linked document (its equally valid for the 702 as the differences are minimal) ""The average resistance at the headphones AKG K 701 is 65.99 Ohm."

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Sennheiser HD598 = superb

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",The reason why the akg is trash is because Harman international was bought by Samsung and productions we’re moved to China So it sounds worse

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

1) Yes, they're comfy, but not for long sessions, after 2-3 hours you just go deaf (taking them off really feels like you've been underwater all this time), cause they're closed-back"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Does the AKG K702 sounds better on the high/medium frequency than the DT770 (but ""better, I mean more clear/neutral, more for a mixing/mastering than for a listening use) ? I have a subpac, so the lack of bass shouldn't be a problem with that, and already own a DT770 (still a great sound and no issue with it after almost 10 years) but want to add a 2nd option (also looking at Audeze which seems to be great but the price is a little bit high)"

If you want even more detail, consider the Dt990 pro open back headphones for a more spacious sound compared to the AKG . Edit - Thanks!

- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","SHURE  SRH440 are fantastic. You should have included them..£58 .
I bought the bryerdynamic DT770 PROS today on your recommendation. My SRH440 sound just as good, not quite as comfy, but half the price."

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.

Terrible first impression etc","One thing to keep in mind if you scouting for headphones: tracking vs mixing! Very different jobs! I personally tend to use the 7506 as a reference for tracking as a soundmixer - they will tell you in split if something is off, the 770 pro by beyerdinamic for mixing live events (bands/concert/etc) and a pair of old akg 271 open for reference mixing in studio/mastering a track or a score. Also, in live events the Senn 280pro is very commun for drummers and bassists.. @inthemix you should have considered what are the first purpose of the headphones and learn them.. exactly like with studio monitors... Still, my hat goes off for work, hassle and effort that you in the video. Keep it up & a warm salute from  Transylvania!"

I like the isolation with the leather cushions and the closed back design. Tipp : In Gaming, I use an EQ and stomp on everything from 16k and up, so the harshness gets away. And they are constantly on sale somewhere as I heard from others :D
Ps: I would also say they have a good amount of bass but this wording could be confusing, because they also have an excellent bass response. It's not too much but just precisely what you put in."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Dt 990 pro 250ohms here😎

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",1 Day Delay

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

9:30 - Final Summary


Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","dt770 pro.

dt770 pro is answer to everything."

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Hilariously the ATH-M40x had some serious clamping on my head but I've used the Sennheiser HD280 Pro (Original, not MK2) and they were totally fine, actually possibly one of the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned next to the 300 Pros that replaced them. Mind you, I did audio production for years with those (HD280) and never had an issue. Dunno if the MK2 may have changed something but many people swear by originals. Also, mind you again, at my nearby Guitar Center I always found the HD280 Pro at $100, not ""$143"", I'd imagine it's a difference in region pricing, Online it's usually $130 (Amazon US), however almost 99% of the time it's $100 (which includes the new MK2)."
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.

Terrible first impression etc","I've been using DT 250's for as long as I can remember. They're comfortable and I know their 'sound'. I had to make a change in my monitoring habits because I live in a flat(and all that that entails)and I came across a company called Sonarworks, that develop software to 'calibrate' your headphones. I tried the free trial and was quite impressed with my mixing results; better balanced instruments and a more clear and defined bass. Have you tried similar software? If so, what are your thoughts?"

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",the Sennheiser 280s headband breaks in (it does not press that hard for me).

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",DT 770 pro with which OHM? Also the amps? are they really that necessary?
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","I have some issues with the DT 770's - For starters, I have a big head - You can extend these headphones to their maximum size and they will fit a big head, which is great, but if you take them off, they will retract and you will have to keep tugging on them to get them to extend to their full size again which makes me feel that I will eventually break them doing this. As a result of this retracting, they also tend to bite me under my earlobes which is rather uncomfortable. "

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Why no Grado? ☹️

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","I have the akg k240 that were on the bottom of the list ahahahaha. Please let me defend them in saying that: 1) I had 50 bucks, 2) I like spacey sound image so that I can mix better, 3) I mostly play rock music, I want the low end to barely be on the way, 3) I mix for hours and I dont have studio monitors. SO they are perfect for those things, PLUS I know them! I know they dont sound perfect and I know what their problems are so I am aware of those when I mix (for example I am not afraid to push the highs because even if they sound harsh in that headset, they won't in other devices). Now I am thinking of stepping up the game and buy something decent for mixing AND tracking, so I want more isolation and more bass this time. Do the DT770 or the M50x have better isolation? (I know about sound you already told us)"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","5:50 how people say those are great is scary to me. When did we lose the ability to critically analyze a product and understand its inherent value, what it offers, and how it's perceived.

It's almost proof that we live in a programmed society designed to TELL you what is good through marketing and advertisement campaigns rather than applying your own perspective and judging it objectively, as shown here."
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","there is no difference, BK is just a color code for black in this case"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Have you ever used any noise canceling headphones? Sony, bose etc. Realistically, can you produce in them? I use wh-1000xm3, just because it's only over ear headphones I have."

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Having upgraded from the older HD280s, I found that the MDR 7506 provided clear sound reproduction and a balanced finish; I've made music start to finish on them. I will agree that the build is a bit plasticky and the foam on the cups wear out after a while (I've had mine for 3 years now and they're starting to come apart) but I've never had an issue with the sound quality, so I find it fascinating that you did."

- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Thanks

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","The DT 990 are open back so ideally suited to Mixing and mastering music. The sound stage is more spacious and you can percieve the depth and width of audio material with more ease. However, the DT770 are closed back headphones and sound more punchy, they are also suitable for recording as they will isolate the sound and not leak sound into the room. Both are a good option but I prefer the 770 as they are more versatile :)"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",I use the DT1990Pro every day and rate them very highly
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

I used one for the last 10 years, rolled a 500lbs case on it, threw them on the wall twice and they didn't break. Sound is flat ish, not bad not great, but worth the low price! DT 770 pro sound quality is indeed overall better."

Terrible first impression etc","Lots of YouTubers hate on the M50x. I have ran through a decent gamut of headphones and I just kept going back. I’m not looking for studio monitors with neutral sound, I want to enjoy music and in my commute the M50x does the trick it brings the soundstage in so that the outside noise doesn’t overwhelm my listening. ANC headphones give me headaches because they sound like a vacuum on my ears. A good pair of open back headphones are a dime a dozen but a good closed back are so hard to come by."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","what do you think about AIAIAI TMA-2 Studio Preset ? are the any better than 
Beyerdynamic DT 990 PRO ? and also, would you recommend 770 PRO over 990 PRO ?"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","I own a pair of Beyerdynamic D770 M's (80ohm) and several pairs of Sony MDR 7506's. I prefer the MDR 7506's. They actually sound better as the ear pads become more pliable.  There are also inexpensive replacement parts readily available on the internet. The DT 770's sound boxy and harsh to my ears, but they are relatively accurate in terms of mixing. The design is horrible however,  as you can easily pinch (painfully) your fingers on the metal bands when putting them on. You stated the Audio Technica's have a ""ton"" of bass. Why would you want a ton of anything when mixing? Your frequent use of the word ""soundstage"" tells me you might prefer the sound of consumer headphones or possibly open back studio head phones? In the end it's all subjective once you learn the sound of your particular monitoring devices, in which case comfort (if your spend a lot of time wearing headphones) it equally as important as sound. Thanks for the review."

But in the last few months I've been perfecting an EQ curve that makes them flatter. Once that's out of the way they have really great definition and that paired with the sound isolation makes them an absolute pleasure to use. The headband and ear cups DO get waaay softer but it just takes a while. If you are a pro by all means just buy a new pair, but if you are like me don't give up, there is hope!"

Terrible first impression etc","I appreciate the time and money spent for this video. However, I think it lacks in scientific content: the exact testing procedure wasn't disclosed. I find myself to be even less decided on which pair of headphones to buy because of the subjectivity of the reviews. Don't get me wrong, I think it's great to have the viewpoint of professional sound designers. The thing is, this video can ONLY be a viewpoint, and nothing general can be took out of it."

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.

Terrible first impression etc","The testing involved listening to masters I was familiar with or produced myself, using the headphones to pinpoint frequencies with EQ and also casual listening of my favourite music. I don’t care what the listed scientific data is for the headphones, the frequency range, the sonarworks audio profile etc because whatever is measured is not what a human ear perceives. The nature of a video like this is, of course, very naturally biased towards my exact listening profile and the health of my ears etc but this is why there is an open market where anyone and everyone can make YouTube video reviews of gear. It’s good to have lots of voices contributing. I also think that me putting my reputation on the line, with my name, face and channel is a lot more trustworthy than a random amazon review, reddit post or sponsored blog post on a music gear magazine :)"

Terrible first impression etc"," @In The Mix  Of course! I can't dispute that you're a talented, experienced producer, and that this video is making the overall knowledge about headphones on the market really better. The problem I have with it lies actually in the difference between what I expected before I listened to it and when I did it, and as I said above now I'm even less decided than before about whether I should change speakers or not. What I meant by ""scientific content"" was more ""facts based content"" than ""white paper content"": I was expecting to be able to reproduce your experiments on my setup. I wish the market was less of a ""spend some money until you're satisfied"" thingy and more of a ""spend some time looking for specs that match your ears"" thingumabob. Your video isn't bad, it's just that I expected something else I guess. Anyways, keep up the great content! Your content helped me getting better at music production. Also, thanks for your sincere and upstanding reply :D"

Terrible first impression etc",i agree with the points on the akg702. without an custom eq curve on my listen bus in studio one i couldnt judge the bass in my projects correctly. they by themselves dont have neutral sounding lowend but theyre lacking it. so i can imagine people who start out mixing on those will eventually end up boosting their lowend way too high or wont notice issues in the deeper bass areas at all without eq adjustments.. now after 6 month theyre starting to break down on me which is more or less my fault but i take the chance and want to try a different pair. is there a huge difference in terms of frequency response and reliability when it comes to mixing between the 702s and 770s? because you got me interested in the DTs ^^

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc",I had a DT770pro 250 but send them back because it had to less low mids and bass. Several test tracks didn’t sound as they normally do in this headphones. Tried them at a focusrite scarlett solo. I found out afterwards that the scarlett solo doesn’t support the high 250ohm version. Does anybody know the 80ohm will have more mid lows and bass? Currently i’m using the M50x but the clear detailed sound was better on the DT770.

And compared to my Maona brand headphones that came in a bundle with a mic and a mic stand all just for $60 on Amazon... compared to the $200 DT 770 PRO 250 OHM headphones right now it looks like the $60 maona brand ones are winning. It’s just that the DT 770 PRO 250 OHM headphones have really low sound. Like REALLY low. I had the volume up all the way on my focusrite but it felt like I had the volume  half way. It’s very hard for me to mix because I can’t hear the difference between my voice and the beat and etc. Everyone saying these headphones are good, is there something I’m doing wrong?"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Just ordered the M40X, was terribly close to buying the 280HD or the AKGK240s, thanks for the affirmation, literally the most comprehensive and simplistic channel on the internet for producers out there rn, big ups !!"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.

Terrible first impression etc"," @Christos Vogiatzis  A beautiful set of headphones, 9/10 would recommend, superb soundscape, feels like a stage, even previously unheard minor elements surfaced when i put them on, when i use FL, feels like you are so close to the software, 2 sets of cables come with it, a long coiled one amd a short one, as i have a pretty big workspace using the big cable makes me feel very free. output frequency beautiful, pads are leathered and ear fits perfectly after the first few days of adjustment"

Terrible first impression etc"," @Christos Vogiatzis  if you want me to point out the bad i would say, it gets super hot after the first 10 mins even, after a good 20 mins its normal to see ting drops of sweat when using in studio, if you plan on going outside with it, itll definitely get  lots of swear as it is closed back, but the sound experience is worth it i would say.
im kinda scared, continous sweat would cause it to wear out but till now, its still as good as new, albeit how easily it gets sweaty pisses me off "

One thing that everyone should put in their brains - the open backs will never have the bass a closed back headphones have, physically impossible. Also have M50(x), but they are not flat but V shaped, uncomfortable and squeaky. The pads and headband flakes after a while. M40X is a better value."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Which one is more better for foot steps in fps competitive games like rainbow six siege no matter about price ?

In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","I'm torn between the Audio Technica M30 and M40, there wasn't a direct comparison in the video. Is the higher price of M40 worth it?"

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","Ahaha For me, it's M40X for flat and accurate ad headphones or nothing else. The M40X are a bit more comfortable than the m30xs and I am ok with the but of peeling and I just clean the pads of headphones and the top band with a not very wet wet wipe and then dry them a bit with a towel. The m40xs are also better than the m50xs to my ears and even the m70xs which are both more expensive. They were better than some of the other headphones to me I tried at a store and I am glad they were not ridiculously expensive too. They are super stron with many drops have not even dented it, I just had to apply some electrical tape on the not so durable headphone jack input side which was fine since it's black tape I used. FYI, you could use bass traps and sound pannels to get some speakers to sounds more like them. I got my Fostex 0.3 (best flatter small speakers I have heard) which are discontinued which is sad to sound more like my m40xs by making my room more dead. Genelec has some small speakers that are good for flatness but they are super expensive ahaha so the iLoud a decent other choice for the sound I think, but those have a funkier look to them I think. Ahh audio videos, I could go on on some videos about audio things, but good sound from audio gear for lots of people is important L0L."

1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.

4) Reveal the depth of audio material.

Terrible first impression etc","I already have DT990 pros, but was looking to buy a closed back pair for tracking purposes. Even before watching this video I was more lenient towards DT770 pros since I know how good the Beyer sound signature is. Now after watching this I almost made up my mind. Highly appreciate if you could check out Austrian Audio Hi-X55 and may be do a comparison video with Beyers. I know that they are bit expensive compared to Beyers, but would love to hear your opinion speacially about the sound quality. Thank you for the good content."

Terrible first impression etc","I had M50X but to me, they had too high treble and mids didn't have much space as in Grado SR80e, also they were not comfortable on my head since I wear glasses. I did not like those headphones very much, honestly surprised how popular they are. Even Cloud Alphas cost like 60 euros here and they have 50mm drivers, every frequency range is clean plus so much more comfortable, I don't get what people see in M50x honestly"

Terrible first impression etc","0:11 I would have guessed AKG 240 Studio Mk2 - I prefer the gold ones - Mk1 - a lot of American studios have them - I just love the shit out of these - light weight, open sounding, not expensive. Slight weakness in the bass, but you never get tired of hearing them. They take about 30 hours to burn in though, so maybe you didn't give them enough time :P
the thing is, once you're used to these all other headphones sound super piercing with way exaggerated bass. I really cannot reproduce the ""muddy"" aspect of them at all. I like half open systems for mixing because it makes you feel much more ""in the room""."

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Wrong move on choosing the mkii of the AkG k240 for review.  They are known for being low quality and or bad sound.  The mk1 is much better imo and if you could get a used pair of vintage original K240's even better.  
The badges on the headphones you should have looked into are golden/yellow in color not blue.  The k240 gets high reviews for classical listening and other music styles with non-heavy bass laden tracks.   Yah they're not for rock and roll or rap, they sound like shit for most of the time you're listening to those genres (excluding some later Mac Miller albums, magic) "

The Sennheiser hd280 is great for drummers. If you want a headphone to play drums that’s the one. Best in sound and comfort than Vic Firth and even this “lack” of highs is great to play with less fatigue over time. Instant less cymbals and more bass drum.
Same what happens with those cheap in ears from KZ. The zs 10 pro is the overall best, but the zs7 is better for drummers and bass players because the boosted lows and more controlled highs. Just my thoughts."

Terrible first impression etc",The 7506 were probably fakes. Those are meant to reveal high frequency artifacts. They are not flattest but they provided a good representation of your mix. You might want to double check your test with someone else's pair. I did the same test you did but I bought more expensive headphones. I ended up keeping the DT880 Pro by Beyerdynamic. The AKG702 for less than $280? Those are fake too. I have the AKG K 702 65th Anniversary and they reveal when a mix is harsh. They are good for revealing mid frequency definition. I hope you didn't buy these from Amazon because half the headphones there are fakes.

YOU NEED AT LEAST 10 min between comparing all those stuff by using your ears. Your ears need rest and restoration time. Especially if you use and test headphones for hours. And the reason of this is in your ears, which is naturally trying to make everything sound right and equalise even the bad sound or every mistake in construction of drivers your phones.Just like your eyes trying to do the same with too dark or too bright image. So that is why you need time to listen and some time to rest. And judging by your conclusion -- you have forgot about that... And i am not saying that you got everything in wrong way, because a lot of people says that Beyerdynamic makes professional audio as well as SONY not. But it is psycological and technically wrong idea to compare it like that.Trully it should be blind test, but if not then you had to at least give a 10 min of time to make your ears ready and steady tests..."

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",I suspect you may have purchased some counterfeit phones.  This is a real problem -especially for SONY brand studio monitors which get knocked off all the time.  Unless you buy directly from the manufacturer - you run the risk of getting fakes.

Its a shame in this covid19 climate we can't just go into stores and test headphones. I am out of pocket for £100 quid until my refund comes back in. Think I might settle for Sony in the £30 range .

In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",m50x vs m40x pls

Terrible first impression etc","I used ATH M40X first and the sound is acceptable compared to the price but two things that annoys me is the quality of headband and earpad. I have to buy a new earpad from Brainwavz to replace the original one so I start to looking for a new pair of Headphones and finally I settled down with Beyerdynamic DT770 Pro 80 ohms because of the comfortable when you wear it for a long time and the sound is perfect. And i have one more in-ear monitor that sound great but the price is too cheap, that is “MEE AUDIO M6 PRO 2nd gen”, i often use this when i play live on stage and with spotify."

Terrible first impression etc","I've got the DT990 Pro's and I love them for mixing. They are semi-open back, so they're more breathable and you get some room reflections which help with a truer bass response, compared to the DT770's. I also have the AT M50's that I use for tracking. To me, they are not comfortable at all and I had to replace the ear pads because the faux leather became brittle over time. The mids seem too hyped and colored for me, making them not an ideal choice for mixing, as you want something with a flatter frequency response for mixing."

The amount of sound energy leaving the cups will not cause a meaningful reflection and re enter the headphone. The change in sound is due to design and build changes which distribute sound pressure levels differently in the closed and open back versions."

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","in vocal tracking Sony 7605 are often used on female vocalists with sibilant voices, so they hear themselves exeggurated and tame the harshness in their performance. Also people whose mixes are usually a bit to bright or too heavy in upper mids will have good results with any bright cans like the 7605 (Scheps). Often headphones or speakers that sound horrible can be very useful if  used right (NS10, mixcubes, radios, laptop speakers). After the first balance it always helps to start a mix with a second pair which is a bit dull and forces you to work a bit harder on your slotting, separation and double-check and adjust with a better pair."

Terrible first impression etc","I know you picked headphones based on popularity but a really underrated pair of headphones at the top of this price range are the Philips Fidelio X2HR. They are open back so obviously not good for recording and tracking but for production and mixing you really can't beat them for the price. They have a great sound stage, good imaging, and an sound profile tuned pretty close to the Harman curve so they sound pretty ""neutral."" They have more sub bass extension than most popular open back headphones on the market like the Sennheiser HD600. I've tried several beyerdynamic headphones and am not a huge fan of the somewhat sharp trebles on pretty much every single one of the Beyers. "

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",Really cannot take you seriously when you said the m50x was a top pick.
In The Mix,I Tested The 10 Best Headphones 2020 ($50 to $150),"What are the best headphones for music production and mixing?
It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","Not that you didn't consider it, but with headphones, you have to look at what they're designed to do. There are various kinds of jobs within audio that headphones are designed for.
AKGs....I absolutely agree about their build. However AKG's (not the 240s, they're junk) are primarily geared towards being used as flat engineering/mastering uses. Some people used to use the AKG 141s 25-30 years ago as both, which they worked well for, but not so much the new models. Especially the AKGs below 300."

Terrible first impression etc"," @In The Mix  I dont agree; I’ve been using them for more than 12 years and so far nothing beats them, especially when using analogue synths and equipment and/or mixing from vinyl...the sound is just so pure and crisp, nothing compares to it at the price they are selling them. They are the Porsche 911 of headphones, they tick all the boxes, have a unique concept and design, are indestructible and affordable. There are headphones which might do certain points better, but as an overall package there’s no comparison imo. "

Terrible first impression etc","I've got the Sony MDR-7506 three years ago and what I hate most is the spiral cable that is extremely heavy and after these years, I had to replace the pads because they started flaking. For working (or just listening to music) with headphones I recommend to try Sonarworks Reference (Headphone Edition). That piece of software just made the highs of the 7506s less harsh and makes them sound much more balanced."

Terrible first impression etc","As a Beginner Mixer who owned a Pair of $300 Bose QC35s, the AKG 240s were actually a tremendous upgrade. Sure the Bose are incredible consumer headphones, but for mixing they were as far as could be from honest. They were terrible for referencing. With the AKG240s, my mixes immediately got better. The Bass response is not good enough for mastering, but for mixing, you can tune your ears to them by listening to a lot of music and you can get good mixes out of them."

Terrible first impression etc","I  ardently recommend you to test an Ultrasone headphone.  Even if they have a very bad reputation (they're expensive and the house sound is kinda hollow and sometimes agressives in highs), they're incredible to revelate micro-details and are extremely dynamics.  Furthermore, they re-create a very precise circular 3D soundstage, with a big amount of depth.
I recommand you to have a listen to the Pro580i (bassy), Pro780i (dryer but more explosive) or the open back Pro1480i  ;)"

Terrible first impression etc","I'm using DT 770 pro and these are great but it has little to much bass which is dominating a mids and highs. What happens later, the mix is to loud at mids and highs on a meter plugin. Also DT 770 can handle a lot of really really low end which is very satysfing but these frequecies are not capable by any speaker system. At the begining my mixes were empty on a regular speakers. Need lot of experience to mix in these but i've learned and now is good. I'm courious about AKG K702. These might help in mids and highs whitout filtering bands. I got multichannel headphone amp so it would be easy to switch just the headphones."

I use them for mixing and live recording with shotgun mic and they are great at revealing ""the bad"" in the audio. I also have Sennheiser HD650's, but for some reason I turn to these headphones more often because of that low bass response. Of course you need to EQ the MDR-7506 if you want to listen to music and replace the god awful earpads with Brainwavz real leather pads with memory foam! I'd recommend using APO Equalizer with Peace plugin/extension, they will sound awesome, if you like listening to music with totally flat response!"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",I got m30x😃

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",They are much cheaper in the UK as they are now produced in China (unlike the DT770 made in Germany)

Terrible first impression etc","Id get your ears checked. The Sony MDR 7506 are great studio headphones and superbly balanced. Build quality is great but they are tight on your ears when new which isn't so great, but give them a few months of use and they loosen like an old pair of comfy shoes. I think you've judged these on first impression, they aren't aesthetically pleasing on the eye and it may have influenced your judgment.  Best headphones ive ever had and I was always a sennheiser guy before."

Terrible first impression etc"," @stephenc909  Stephen, im not interested in people 'believing' what I say.  What I do  'believe' is that In The Mix is doing the MDR 7506 some injustice.  They are a great pair of Studio headphones, very well balanced.  In the Mix has a great channel with great content, but he's wrong on this.  They aren't hung up in studios across the world for nothing.  If you can make a mix sound great on the 7506's, they sound great on anything.  All the best -Paul"

Terrible first impression etc","Just make test of SUPERLUX you will find that the quality is much better and more dynamic than in AKG and more clear that Beyerdynamic DT770 - it regards SUPERLUX hd681F flat response for monitoring also HD 668B with amazing bass. The HD 660 150 OHMS the are the Beyerdynamic killer.... the prices are ridiculously cheap but the sound quality is realy amazing dynamic, bright... yes but this is a shame for producer to admit that he is using it.... the trademark should be the sign of the quality, I have tested many models. Only AKG 702 you can find more details in music... but Superlux is worth of its price, I am the music producer and I have two pairs of superlux...I highly recommend the SUPERLUX headphones if you are looking for headphones with great dynamics...             I have been disappointed with famous AKG while testing."

Terrible first impression etc","I have dt 990 and 770 and I highly believe you need both for mixing. If you mix only on 770, your final is gonna be too boomi because it handles much more bass than regular car speakers for example so you think bass is great but it's actually too much, on the other hand 990 is too bassi so you cut too much base and your final is gonna be too thin. So you need to mix with both to get the best results, also I don't recommend 880 for edm music, 880 is perfect for classical music,"

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","those sonys are good for.. Mastering! not mixing! they are a ""reference headphone"" as in, you don't get bass, because you hear the music however you hear it, it sounds compressed because you are able to hear everything wrong about your mix instead of having a flavor, BUT! I would say they need headphones that are as flat response as these, that have a better bass extention, so you can actually master for bass instead of having bass headphones that could color the sound in an undesired effect (aka.. boosted bass, instead of boosted bass, want more of the idea of the bass, for more Accurate bass.)"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc","You absolutely do not master on headphones. And sounding overly compressed isn't going to help your mix - once the song has already been mixed, it's too late to make adjustments. So ""mastering headphones"" would be worthless.

And no, they're not ""reference headphones"" either (the proper terminology is ""monitoring headphones"" and they certainly aren't flat frequency response, as there's actually a DIP in the bass."

How the hell would anyone make a fair decision on which ones to buy. OFC!! I do agree that comfort and the features matter to some extent but the most crucial part has been overlooked in this review. You obviously sorted through the 90% trash headphones which is absolutely fair enough but I don't think that makes for a ""The 10 best studio headphones"" title. Only two to three of them are reasonable judging by your final verdicts and even on those people will have different results for different people because they make different music and thats where the frequency response curves would make or break this."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

2. Engineering

When headphones are used for recording and mixing, it more about the personal taste of the person wearing them. You want the sound to meet what they wearer likes. It’s kinda like when you create a mix send for someone. Each artist will have a mix send that is to their liking. Not really focusing on the flatness of the sound or detail of the sound."

Notes:
- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc","Sorry but burn in is fake, at least on the m40x.  The thing that change the sound the most are the earpads that softens and get pressed over time. That's why i never fold them"

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc"," @gigi gigiotto  Well I certainly don’t go through forums but from an electronic perspective, components and systems are known to take time to reach their equilibrium or standard mode of function. When studying circuits during my engineering degree, I remember observing that systems are not as linear and predictable as the theory! I would suggest testing it for yourself, you will hear the difference :)"

Actually in the first pair i burned in for 48h. 2 years later i bought 2 more pairs, one for me and one for a friend. I burned in mine and left untouched my friends pair, and heard no difference. On what headphones have you heard the most difference? Might be the different membrane material"

But my headset is really weak, the low end are really bad, i mean that the low end is actually really low, like...quiet. And the headset i generelly too low. I don't have an amplifier or anything, my soundcard are not anything special, its just the default soundcard. I don't know if that is the reason, but y have turned my volume up to 100%, and yes, i have been checking everything in sound settings ect. the headset is at its loudest, but it is really not that loud, i guess when i am watching netflix and all that its fine. But the fact that it is on 100% volume, and my ears aren't even close to hurt or anything if you know what i mean?. Sry for my english lol, im from Denmark, but yeah, if you know what my problem is, please help :)"

- It appears that the AKG K702 is now produced in China (it used to be made in Europe and cost much more). This likely explains why my experience doesn't match what others have said in previous years. 
- The DT 770 pro really is a step above the rest here and if you can afford it, I think it offers the best price to performance out of these 10.
- There were many other headphones which didn't even make it to this top 10 due to:
Lack of customer support/brand new company with no track record
Terrible first impression etc",buy a cheap headphones. slap on sonarworks and make them balanced.

It's a good question! Today I hope to help answer it. Please ask me anything about any of the headphones in the comments of this video and I will reply with detailed notes and feedback :)

Good headphones should:
1) Provide an accurate, spacious sound stage to aid in mixing and mastering music.
2) Reveal low, mid and high frequencies without distortion so you can make quick production decisions.
3) Faithfully reproduce the dynamics and transient response of the material. 
4) Reveal the depth of audio material.
5) Feel comfortable on your head for many hours and be strong enough to withstand daily ues.

Terrible first impression etc",Compared to the beats headphones which blast bass the m40x are more flat sounding than the beats. If you want bass for that price I would stick to the beats. But if you want clarity and a great soundstage I would say the m40s are great. If you are mixing. Beat headphones are horrible. Disgusting even.
